This alarm clock has a Clock showing the current time (seconds, mins, hrs should change as time changes). There are some input boxes to set an alarm (hr, min, sec, am/pm). Once the time is set and clicked “Set Alarm” button, the alarm is added to the list below. When the alarm goes off JS alert function is used to alert the browser and a beeping sound starts which will be looping for about 15 secs. Moreover, there will be a delete option for each list item so that the user can delete the alarm whenever he/she wants. https://its-roshanojha.github.io/Alarm-Clock/ - CUSTOM LINK FOR THE PROJECT
